## Overview
This repository provides a variety of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for training and deploying ML models in finance. It covers key applications of AI in the financial industry, including:

- Credit scoring models
- Fraud detection models
- Customer segmentation using clustering
- Time-series forecasting for stock prices
- Sentiment analysis for market predictions

These models leverage data science techniques and financial datasets to provide insights that support decision-making in a financial context.

## Technologies
The repository utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Scikit-Learn** for ML algorithms
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for deep learning
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **XGBoost** for boosting models
- **SQLAlchemy** for database connections

## Features
- **Credit Scoring:** Predicts creditworthiness using logistic regression and random forest models.
- **Fraud Detection:** Detects fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection techniques and neural networks.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Implements k-means clustering to segment customers based on financial data.
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Provides time-series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Extracts sentiment from news or social media to influence market prediction models.
